While climbing, we always look at the tip of the rock just to realize it is too far away. What is also important is to realize that there are people who might have just started this journey and your "learning journey" could go a long way in helping them.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p> <h3 id="mce_14">Help people learn from your mistakes</h3> <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p> <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Share your mistakes with the community. We as a community learn from each other's mistakes and experiences and these things are really valuable. </p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Your blog on "<em>Failing with Microservices</em>" could help me in avoiding some mistakes or at least rethink my design if I am starting with microservices.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p> <h3>Get feedback from community</h3> <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p> <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>There are a lot of things which help us grow as an individual and one of them is feedback or I should say "<em>Constructive Feedback</em>". Write to get feedback from community, to get their thoughts, to hear their experiences and to learn from all of these. Let's see how this could work. </p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Say, I am very excited to use Coroutines to build reactive streams in my next project and I share an article "<em>Being Reactive with Kotlin Coroutines</em>" which talks about the basics of Coroutines and abstractions like "<em>Channel</em>" to implement reactive streams. </p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>This article receives a lot of feedback and one of the feedback says - </p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- wp:quote --></p> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Hey, nicely put. I would suggest you to check this <a href="https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/reactive/coroutines-guide-reactive.md">link.</a> It says -</p> <p><em>"There is no way to receive the elements from a channel again. The channel is closed when the producer coroutine is over and the attempt to receive from it again cannot receive anything."</em></p> <p>You might also want to take a look at <a href="https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/reactive/kotlinx-coroutines-rx2">kotlinx-coroutines-rx2.</a></p> </blockquote> <p><!-- /wp:quote --></p> <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Now, this is important as it helps me understand a lot of dimensions including backpressure, hot and cold observables which I had not considered.

You become someone who would share his/her ideas with confidence.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p> <h3>Challenges you to write better every time</h3> <p><!-- /wp:heading --></p> <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>You challenge yourself to write better every time.
